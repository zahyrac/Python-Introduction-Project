# Python Introduction Project
This programming project contains four python programs that solve different exercise questions.
1. The first program calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature.

- It asks the user to input initial weight,  and initial/desired temperature of the water.  Then it calculates the energy. 

2. The second program calculates a person's Body Mass Index based on user input of height and weight.

It asks the user to input a height in inches and weight in pounds. Then it Calculate the BMIs using a formula.
